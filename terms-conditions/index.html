However, even if the third party is affiliated with Manomay's, Manomay's has no control over these linked sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Manomay's. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Manomay's seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).
